        "description": "Then, the content of the PC is increased to point to the next instruction to be executed, and a new fetch cycle starts again. In this specific case, the PC is incremented by two because the RAM memory is organized in bytes, and the size of each CPU instruction is two bytes. It is worthwhile noticing here that real CPUs, in order to improve their speed, perform the increment of the PC in parallel to previous operations, during the Execute cycle."
