          This e-book, along with the accompanying CPUVSIM software, 
          has been created by students for students as part of a multi-year OER-enabled pedagogy project integrated into their traditional educational activities. 
          This approach seeks to address the unfortunate waste of resources associated with "disposable" traditional assignments. 
          Instead, it demonstrates the feasibility of a self-sustainable process where students actively participate in iteratively improving and extending open resources. 
          Through this, they develop their professionalism while contributing to the common good. 
          These activities, conducted within the framework of Computing for Social Good, 
          aim to prepare the next generation of computer scientists: 
          not just equipped with coding skills but also empowered to wield technology for the betterment of society.
